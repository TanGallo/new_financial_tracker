    <string name="budget">Budget</string>
    <string name="budget_1">When you created DEBTS or SAVINGS accounts, MYnance automatically creates linked income and expenses categories in your BUDGET. In order to preserve linked data properly, you can only delete these items by deleting the parent accounts in either DEBTS or SAVINGS.</string>
    <string name="budget_2">Simply use the PLUS buttons to add income categories (all your sources of incoming money) and expenses categories (all the things you spend your money on).</string>
    <string name="budget_3">You make a budget for 2 reasons:</string>
    <string name="budget_4">1. To make sure you are not spending more money than you earn.</string>
    <string name="budget_5">2. To give you spending guidelines for optional items like gifts, entertainment, clothing, etc.</string>
    <string name="budget_6">MYnance will alert you if your budget does not balance (i.e. if you are spending more money than you earn).</string>
    <string name="budget_7">A realistic budget captures all the major areas of your spending, without getting too bogged down in details.</string>
    <string name="budget_8">For example, you could create a category for \"kids\' lessons\", as opposed to 3 separate categories for \"Tommy\'s hockey\", \"Trina\'s dance\", and \"swimming lessons\".</string>
    <string name="budget_9">\"Optional\" expenses categories are not necessary in order to use this app, however including them in your BUDGET will give you valuable spending guidelines in your daily life. For example, you will learn how often you can afford to spend money on entertainment or how much money you can afford to spend on gifts.</string>
    <string name="budget_10">Payments made to DEBTS and SAVINGS will be added to your budget automatically and treated as needs, so that the money will be \'reserved\' in your bank account.</string>
    <string name="budget_11">You should also adjust your budget any time a major change occurs (i.e. you get a raise at work or the amount of a payment changes).</string>
    <string name="budget_12">You should review and update your budget at least once a year.</string>
    <string name="budget_13">You can use the SPENDING REPORT as a guideline when updating your budget. Running a spending report for an entire year will show you how much you actually spent in each category.</string>
    <string name="budget_14">Updating your budget will not adjust your bank account balances retroactively. The app will simply adjust the percentage of future entries to \'reserve\' for needs in accordance with the changes made to the budget.</string>

    <string name="credit_card_2">For each purchase, you will select an expense item in your BUDGET, such as \'insurance\' or \'entertainment. You will also select which DEBTS item to map the purchase against.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_3">The DEBTS item\'s balance owing will be updated accordingly.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_4">NOTE: Be careful about mapping a purchase to the same BUDGET and DEBTS item.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_5">It is possible to use a DEBTS item as the selected budget item. For example, if you took money from a credit card to pay down a line of credit.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_6">In that case, the amount of the payment would be added to the balance owing on the credit card and subtracted from the balance owing on the line of credit. If you mapped to the same item twice, the balance owing on the DEBTS item would not update correctly.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_7">MYnance wants to help you develop healthy spending habits. It will alert you if you are making purchases against your DEBTS items when you don\'t have the funds in your account to cover them.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_8">Although purchases entered in this tab will have no effect on your \'total\' and \'available to spend\' balances, you should still avoid accumulating consumer debt.</string>
    <string name="credit_card_9">Payments to your DEBTS items should be made in the PAY CC tab. Your \'total\' and \'available to spend\' balances will change when payments are made in the PAY CC tab and the DEBTS item\'s balance owing will be updated accordingly.</string>

    <string name="debts_2">The app has calculated that the debt will not be paid off in a reasonable amount of time. Either the interest is too high or the payments are too low or too infrequent.</string>
    <string name="debts_3">Simply click on the pencil icon next to the account in the DEBTS screen and enter the new interest rate. A new debt-free date will calculated.</string>
    <string name="debts_4">When you created the DEBTS account, a linked income category was created for you in your BUDGET. Simply click on the pencil icon next to it on the BUDGET screen and enter the amount of income that you plan on taking from the DEBTS account. A new debt-free date will be calculated accordingly.</string>
    <string name="debts_5">Create an expenses category in your BUDGET called \"interest\" (or something similar). Use the DAILY MONEY - CREDIT CARD tab to create entries against that category (in the 1st pull-down menu), charged against the DEBTS account (in the 2nd pull-down menu).</string>
    <string name="debts_6">If you take a cash advance off a DEBTS item, you can enter the transaction in the DAILY MONEY - MONEY IN tab. You bank account balances will be adjusted accordingly. DON\'T FORGET that only a percentage of that deposit will be \'available to spend\'.</string>
    <string name="debts_7">If you take frequent cash advances off DEBTS items, you should adjust your BUDGET to reflect this income.</string>

    <string name="daily_money_q3">I put money into my account, but the \"Available to Spend\" amount is still zero.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q4">It seems like the wrong amount is going into the \"Available to Spend\" amount.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_4">The app will reserve the percentage of any money you put into your bank account that you identified in your BUDGET as being needed to pay for \"needs\". Only the balance of your income will be \"Available to Spend\".</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q5">The DAILY MONEY - MONEY IN tab only allows me to put money into my bank account. Where do I go to put money into my other accounts?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5">Any other accounts you have can be set up as DEBTS or SAVINGS.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5A">To transfer money from your bank account to another account, use the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab. Use the pull-down menu to choose the account where you want the money to go.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5B">To transfer funds from a DEBTS account to another account, use the DAILY MONEY - CREDIT CARD tab. Use the pull-down menu to choose the account where you want the money to go and use the 2nd pull-down menu to choose which DEBTS account the money should come from.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5C">To transfer funds from a SAVINGS account to another account, use the DAILY MONEY - MONEY IN tab to transfer the money from the SAVINGS account to your bank account. Then, use the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab to transfer the same amount into the appropriate account.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q6">When I take a cash withdrawal from my bank account, how can I record what I spend the money on?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_6">How you handle cash withdrawals is a personal choice.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_6A">You can create a \"cash withdrawal\" expenses category in your BUDGET and record the transaction once against it, or you can choose to record where every dollar of the cash withdrawal was spent against several expenses categories.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_6B">MYnance believes the 2nd method will become tedious and is an unrealistic way to manage your money. It should suffice to record the cash withdrawal as a whole. You can use the SPENDING REPORT to identify if frequent cash withdrawals are a problem area for you.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q7">What is the difference between using the DAILY MONEY - PAY CC tab or the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab to record a payment to my credit card?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_7">MYnance believes strongly in avoiding consumer debt on credit cards. The DAILY MONEY - PAY CC tab is built specifically for this purpose.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_7A">Using this tab once a week or more to make frequent payments to your credit card will ensure that you never pay interest on those purchases, but you will still earn the rewards that your credit card offers! </string>
    <string name="daily_money_7B">You can also make additional payments that don\'t map to specific purchases by using the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q8">Why does MYnance give me spending warnings when I\'m using my credit card?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_8">MYnance believes that blind spending on credit cards leads to consumer debt. That is why we will alert you if you don\'t have the funds to cover your credit card purchases.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q9">What are weekly limits and how can I set them up?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_9">When you identify an expense category in your BUDGET as \"optional\", the app will ask you if you\'d like to track your spending on a weekly basis. If yes, you can use the DAILY MONEY - WEEKLY LIMITS tab to see how much has been spent between Monday and Sunday of this week against that category.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q10">Why am I unable to delete some of the items in the DAILY MONEY - CREDIT CARD tab?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_10">Once you\'ve made a payment to a credit card against a particular purchase, that purchase can no longer be deleted.</string>
    <string name="budget_q1">Why can\'t I delete certain income or expenses categories?</string>
    <string name="budget_q2">I need guidance to make a budget.</string>
    <string name="budget_q3">How often should I make changes to my budget?</string>
    <string name="debts_q1">I need guidance to enter debts accounts.</string>
    <string name="debts_q2">Why does the date come up as \"Too far in the future\"?</string>
    <string name="debts_q3">What if the interest rate changes on my DEBTS account?</string>
    <string name="debts_q4">I frequently take cash advances off a DEBTS account, how should I get the app to handle this?</string>
    <string name="debts_q5">How can I record the interest I get charged on my DEBTS accounts?</string>
    <string name="savings_q1">I need guidance to enter savings accounts.</string>
    <string name="savings_q3">What if the interest rate changes in my SAVINGS account?</string>
    <string name="savings_q4">I frequently take cash withdrawals from a SAVINGS account, how should I get the app to handle this?</string>
    <string name="savings_q5">I don\'t have a particular financial goal I\'m trying to achieve, I want to know how much I\'ll accumulate by a certain date.</string>
