    <string name="budget">Budget</string>
    <string name="budget_1">When you created DEBTS or SAVINGS accounts, MYnance automatically creates linked income and expenses categories in your BUDGET. In order to preserve linked data properly, you can only delete these items by deleting the parent accounts in either DEBTS or SAVINGS.</string>
    <string name="budget_2">Simply use the PLUS buttons to add income categories (all your sources of incoming money) and expenses categories (all the things you spend your money on).</string>
    <string name="budget_3">You make a budget for 2 reasons:</string>
    <string name="budget_4">1. To make sure you are not spending more money than you earn.</string>
    <string name="budget_5">2. To give you spending guidelines for optional items like gifts, entertainment, clothing, etc.</string>
    <string name="budget_6">MYnance will alert you if your budget does not balance (i.e. if you are spending more money than you earn).</string>
    <string name="budget_7">A realistic budget captures all the major areas of your spending, without getting too bogged down in details.</string>
    <string name="budget_8">For example, you could create a category for \"kids\' lessons\", as opposed to 3 separate categories for \"Tommy\'s hockey\", \"Trina\'s dance\", and \"swimming lessons\".</string>
    <string name="budget_9">\"Optional\" expenses categories are not necessary in order to use this app, however including them in your BUDGET will give you valuable spending guidelines in your daily life. For example, you will learn how often you can afford to spend money on entertainment or how much money you can afford to spend on gifts.</string>
    <string name="budget_11">You should also adjust your budget any time a major change occurs (i.e. you get a raise at work or the amount of a payment changes).</string>
    <string name="budget_12">You should review and update your budget at least once a year.</string>
    <string name="budget_13">You can use the SPENDING REPORT as a guideline when updating your budget. Running a spending report for an entire year will show you how much you actually spent in each category.</string>
    <string name="budget_14">Updating your budget will not adjust your bank account balances retroactively. The app will simply adjust the percentage of future entries to \'reserve\' for needs in accordance with the changes made to the budget.</string>

    <string name="daily_money">Daily Money</string>
    <string name="daily_money_1">\"Total in Account\" is the total amount of money in your bank account. A percentage of this money is reserved for paying \"needs\", as identified by you in your BUDGET.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_2">\"Available to Spend\" is the amount of money that you can spend on \"optional\" expenses, as identified by you in your BUDGET.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_3">This app is smart! When you overspend, it won\'t make money \"Available to Spend\" until you\'ve caught up on having enough money reserved for paying the \"needs\" you\'ve identified in your BUDGET.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_4">The app will reserve the percentage of any money you put into your bank account that you identified in your BUDGET as being needed to pay for \"needs\". Only the balance of your income will be \"Available to Spend\".</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5">Any other accounts you have can be set up as DEBTS or SAVINGS.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5A">To transfer money from your bank account to another account, use the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab. Use the pull-down menu to choose the account where you want the money to go.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5B">To transfer funds from a DEBTS account to another account, use the DAILY MONEY - CREDIT CARD tab. Use the pull-down menu to choose the account where you want the money to go and use the 2nd pull-down menu to choose which DEBTS account the money should come from.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_5C">To transfer funds from a SAVINGS account to another account, use the DAILY MONEY - MONEY IN tab to transfer the money from the SAVINGS account to your bank account. Then, use the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab to transfer the same amount into the appropriate account.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_6">How you handle cash withdrawals is a personal choice.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_6A">You can create a \"cash withdrawal\" expenses category in your BUDGET and record the transaction once against it, or you can choose to record where every dollar of the cash withdrawal was spent against several expenses categories.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_6B">MYnance believes the 2nd method will become tedious and is an unrealistic way to manage your money. It should suffice to record the cash withdrawal as a whole. You can use the SPENDING REPORT to identify if frequent cash withdrawals are a problem area for you.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_7">MYnance believes strongly in avoiding consumer debt on credit cards. The DAILY MONEY - PAY CC tab is built specifically for this purpose.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_7A">Using this tab once a week or more to make frequent payments to your credit card will ensure that you never pay interest on those purchases, but you will still earn the rewards that your credit card offers! </string>
    <string name="daily_money_7B">You can also make additional payments that don\'t map to specific purchases by using the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_8">MYnance believes that blind spending on credit cards leads to consumer debt. That is why we will alert you if you don\'t have the funds to cover your credit card purchases.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_9">When you identify an expense category in your BUDGET as \"optional\", the app will ask you if you\'d like to track your spending on a weekly basis. If yes, you can use the DAILY MONEY - WEEKLY LIMITS tab to see how much has been spent between Monday and Sunday of this week against that category.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_10">Once you\'ve made a payment to a credit card against a particular purchase, that purchase can no longer be deleted.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q1">What does \"Total in Account\" mean?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q2">What does \"Available to Spend\" mean?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q3">I put money into my account, but the \"Available to Spend\" amount is still zero.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q4">It seems like the wrong amount is going into the \"Available to Spend\" amount.</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q5">The DAILY MONEY - MONEY IN tab only allows me to put money into my bank account. Where do I go to put money into my other accounts?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q6">When I take a cash withdrawal from my bank account, how can I record what I spend the money on?</string>
    <string name="daily_money_q7">What is the difference between using the DAILY MONEY - PAY CC tab or the DAILY MONEY - MONEY OUT tab to record a payment to my credit card?</string>

    <string name="debts_2">The app has calculated that the debt will not be paid off in a reasonable amount of time. Either the interest is too high or the payments are too low or too infrequent.</string>
    <string name="debts_3">Simply click on the pencil icon next to the account in the DEBTS screen and enter the new interest rate. A new debt-free date will calculated.</string>
    <string name="debts_4">When you created the DEBTS account, a linked income category was created for you in your BUDGET. Simply click on the pencil icon next to it on the BUDGET screen and enter the amount of income that you plan on taking from the DEBTS account. A new debt-free date will be calculated accordingly.</string>
    <string name="debts_5">Create an expenses category in your BUDGET called \"interest\" (or something similar). Use the DAILY MONEY - CREDIT CARD tab to create entries against that category (in the 1st pull-down menu), charged against the DEBTS account (in the 2nd pull-down menu).</string>
